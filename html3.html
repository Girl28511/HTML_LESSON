    <h1>Practice Session</h1>
<ol>
    <li class="firstline">I'm a big, blue, <strong>strong</strong> paragraph</li>
</ol>
    <p class="secondline">I'm a simple paragraph with grey text</p>
<ol>
    <li class="thirdline">I'm a small (8px to be exact), green, <em>italic</em> paragraph</li>
    <li class="fourthline">I'm a right-aligned, bold, orange paragraph</li>
    <li class="fifthline">I'm a justified, pink paragraph, with a font family of Tahoma</li>
    <li class="sixthline">I'm an underlined, purple paragraph, with three font families Roboto, Helvetica and sans-serif. Just in case I need to "fallback" to supported fonts.</li>
    <li class="seventhline">I'm a paragraph with a yellow background and bold text. My font-family/fallbacks are "Comic Sans MS", "Comic Sans", cursive. I have a line height of 25px.</li>
</ol>

<p> This next part is specifically to learn nth of type selector. For the below I have used ul > li which is a CSS combinator called the child selector: The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I am a sentence with blue violet text and bold - using even nth of type </li>
    <li>I'm a simple paragraph with grey text - using off nth of type</li>
    <li>I am a second sentence with blue violet text and bold same as the first - using even nth of type</li>
    <li>I'm a simple paragraph with grey text same as the second - using odd nth of type</li>
</ul>
<p> This next part is to learn nth of type selector with numbers intead of 'odd or even'.</p>
<p>I am a paragraph with a red background- using nth of type (4) - the fourth P element in my coding - I am also using a General Sibling Selector. The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element </p>
<p>I'm a simple paragraph with orange - using nth of type (5) - the fifth p element in my coding</p>
</ul>
